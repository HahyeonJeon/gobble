# Go Mistakes

## Compose and Run must share one edge contract

**Context:** Related-file output `From` is legal at compose. Thin-slice BAI used it.

**Mistake:** `upstreamReady` only looked up inputs. Output-port `From` composed cleanly and deadlocked at run (`not-started`).

**Correction:** Resolve wait paths at `BuildPlan`. Run reads `Edge.Wait` only. Do not guess from `ToPort`. Add a process-level regression.
